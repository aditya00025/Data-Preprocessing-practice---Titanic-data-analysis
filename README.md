# Titanic Data Analysis

This project conducts **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset, uncovering key insights about passenger features and survival patterns.

## Project Overview:
The analysis focuses on:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Statistical summary and visualizations to identify relationships and trends.
- **Visualizations**: Includes pairplots, heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots to explore the data.
- **Insights**: Understanding survival chances based on features like age, fare, class, and others.

## Steps Involved:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Using `.describe()`, `.info()`, and `.value_counts()` to explore data.
2. **Visualizations**: Generating pairplots, heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing how features like age, fare, and class are correlated with survival.

## Libraries Used:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
